# Task

- Learning objective: Understand and apply conditional statements (if/else).
- Create an HTML form to display the air quality (AQI:air-quality-index) in a range from 0 to 150 using a [range slider](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att%5Finput%5Ftype%5Frange.asp).
- The result should be output in HTML. To do this, the background color of the body should be adjusted accordingly.
- Declare the function checkAirQuality() and use conditional statements (if...else) in the function body.

# Note

- If the quality is less than or equal to 50, the result is:
  Level of health concern: Good Level of health effect: Little or no risk
- If the quality is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 100, the result is:
  Level of health concern: Moderate Level of health effect: Acceptable quality
- If the quality is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 150, the result is:
  Level of health concern: Unhealthy for sensitive groups Level of health effect: Generable publics not likely affected
