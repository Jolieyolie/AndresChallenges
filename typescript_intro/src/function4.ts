// - Learning objective: After completing this exercise, you will be able to change the design of a website with JavaScript and write your own functions for interactive elements.
// - Create four "MagicBalls".
// - Clicking on a MagicBall changes the background color of the <body> and the text color of the <h1>.
// - Use CSS to style the elements. Either use linear-gradient or address each semicircle yourself.
// - Then define the functionality in your JS, i.e., write a separate function for each MagicBall.
