Forms and Values_Level_01

# Task

- Learning objective: After completing this exercise, you will be able to process user input and change the content of a web page (DOM manipulation).
- Create a form in which you can enter a number. Next to it is a button that executes a function called “Double me.” You should therefore declare a function that multiplies the value from your input field by 2. The result is then displayed in your HTML.

# Note

- Add onsubmit="return false" to your form if your page reloads after submission.
